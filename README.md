Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room’s current game is Draw It or Lose It, available only for Android devices. The company is interested in developing a web-based version of this game that can run on a variety of platforms. Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile devices will need to be set up as development environments. In this project, a client-server architecture will be used. It is important to note that only one game can be played at a time. Singletons will be used to prevent multiple games from existing in memory simultaneously. Several teams can play, and teams can have many players, but team and game names have to be unique.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Over the course of the project, I kept a clear perspective. As part of the architectural design, I recommended file storage, database, backend, and client needs.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I experienced a new way of working through each aspect of the application because of the design document. The Development Requirements section needed considerable thought to work through all the relevant details.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
It would be helpful if I could revise the recommendations. I would like to make changes to the application's security based on additional feedback and research.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Since I was responsible for addressing the users' needs on this project, it was very important to make sure they were met. In light of my knowledge of application development, I attempted to interpret them and locate additional solutions to the problems they were seeking.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
An implementation plan guided me through the software design process. I was able to address development concerns as I went through each portion of the application.
